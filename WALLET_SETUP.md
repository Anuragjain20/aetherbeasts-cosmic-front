# Wallet Connection Setup Guide

## Quick Start

Your wallet connection functionality is now fully implemented! Here's what you need to do to get it working:

## 1. Get a WalletConnect Project ID

1. Visit [WalletConnect Cloud](https://cloud.walletconnect.com)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Create a new project
4. Copy your Project ID

## 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `aetherbeasts-cosmic-front` directory:

```bash
# WalletConnect Configuration
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id-here
```

Replace `your-actual-project-id-here` with the Project ID from step 1.

## 3. Features Included

## 4. How It Works

### Connection Flow
1. User clicks "Connect Wallet"
2. Modal opens with wallet options
3. For WalletConnect:
   - QR code is automatically generated
   - User scans with mobile wallet
   - Connection is established
4. For browser wallets (MetaMask, Coinbase):
   - Direct connection prompt
   - User approves in wallet extension

### User Experience
- **Connected State**: Shows truncated wallet address with dropdown
- **Disconnect Option**: Easy disconnect from dropdown menu
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works perfectly on all screen sizes
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for connection issues

## 5. Testing

1. Make sure your `.env` file is configured
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the application
4. Click "Connect Wallet" in the navigation
5. Test different wallet connections:
   - Try MetaMask (if installed)
   - Try WalletConnect QR code with a mobile wallet
   - Try Coinbase Wallet

## 6. Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:

1. âœ… Set up your WalletConnect project ID in production environment
2. âœ… Consider adding custom RPC endpoints for better reliability
3. âœ… Test all wallet connections thoroughly
4. âœ… Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for wallet connections)

## 7. Customization

### Adding More Networks
Edit `src/lib/wagmi.ts` and add chains from `wagmi/chains`:

```typescript
import { arbitrum, optimism } from 'wagmi/chains'

// Add to chains array
chains: [mainnet, sepolia, polygon, base, arbitrum, optimism]

// Add to transports
transports: {
  // ... existing
  [arbitrum.id]: http(),
  [optimism.id]: http(),
}
```

### Adding More Wallets
Add connectors in `src/lib/wagmi.ts`:

```typescript
import { injected } from 'wagmi/connectors'

// Add to connectors array
connectors: [
  // ... existing
  injected({ target: 'trust' }), // Trust Wallet
]
```

## 8. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid Project ID" Error:**
- Ensure your WalletConnect Project ID is correct
- Check that the `.env` file is in the right location
- Restart the development server after adding the Project ID

**QR Code Not Generating:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure WalletConnect Project ID is valid
- Try refreshing the page

**Wallet Not Connecting:**
- Ensure wallet is installed and unlocked
- Check that you're on a supported network
- Try clearing browser cache and cookies

**Mobile Wallet Issues:**
- Ensure mobile wallet supports WalletConnect v2
- Try copying the URI and pasting it directly in the wallet
- Make sure your development server is accessible from mobile device

## 9. Security Notes

- Never commit your actual Project ID to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Consider implementing connection timeout handling
- Add rate limiting for connection attempts if needed
